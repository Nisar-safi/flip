      <p class="mb-4">
        This project provides an overview of active and historical Flipstarters, curated through a manual process due to the decentralized nature of Flipstarter. It is built using SvelteKit by Nisar and was directed and financed by @damascene <a href="https://gitlab.com/uak/" class="has-text-link">GitLab</a>.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        It uses the <a href="https://gitlab.com/dagurval/flipstarter-directory-backend" class="has-text-link">Flipstarter Directory Backend</a> for campaign data. The concept is copied from the original deployment and enhanced to add campaign-specific pages and use static pages.
