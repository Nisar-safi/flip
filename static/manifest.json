  "description": "This project provides an overview of active and historical Flipstarters, curated through a manual process due to the decentralized nature of Flipstarter. It is built using SvelteKit by Nisar and was directed and financed by @damascene. The concept is copied from the original deployment and enhanced to add campaign-specific pages and use static pages. This website, along with the collected Flipstarter data, is licensed under the GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3 (AGPLv3). The source code is available on [repository link].",
